#My first Web Application using Django-Python-Java-Script and a personal customization of Bootstrap. It is a Blog-Tech namely a Blog where I can share information on web technology and programming. I also wanted to cover some topics on hackers, cyber-security and all that stuff.
I've already hosted this blog on heroku at devprojectmyfirstblog.herokuapp.com (beware of the dot between ...blog.herokuapp it's not /herokuapp.com).
EDIT: since November 2022 heroku made his hosting services chargeable and since I cannot afford it, my website has been wiped out. Too bad...
